This repository contains our data and codes related to the project "Modelling the growth effects of sharing health data in ASEAN countries" by Gerhard Kling (University of Aberdeen), Aravinda Meera Guntupalli (University of Aberdeen), and Gazi Salah Uddin (Link√∂ping University).

# World Development Indicators: Reshaping Data using Stata
This video demonstrates data wrangling in Stata. I show you how to get data from the World Development Indicators database into a useable panel data format. We cover the insheet, sort, by, forvalues (loops), and expand commands in Stata. A similar approach can be used for other data providers.

# The impact of e-health on growth: How to develop a methodology?
This video explains how to develop a methodology. This is based on our project "Modelling the growth effects of sharing health data in ASEAN countries" with Gazi Salah Uddin and Aravinda Guntupalli. This video illustrates a data-driven approach to develop a methodology. The main challenge in practice is that some aspects of a problem cannot be quantified due to a lack of data or a lack of measures. This video explains how to develop a methodology using "backward engineering" - i.e. starting with the data, we visualise the problem. Using requirements and various data sources, we can finally establish relationships that can be empirically tested.
